# Java Example Project

This project demonstrates using Java to implement the logic in an application that uses Osiris.

The API definition is written in Kotlin (`ApiDefinition.kt`) but this is the only Kotlin code in the project. The `ComponentsProvider` interface and implementation are written in Java (`JavaComponentsProvider` and `JavaComponentsProviderImpl`). The component used by the Kotlin code is also written in Java (`GreetingFactory`).

The Java code is in a separate module from the API definition. The module containing the API definition (`core`) depends on the module containing the Java code (`components`).

Having separate modules for the Kotlin and Java code is the simplest approach. The Kotlin module generated by the archetype can be used with no changes, and the Java module is a completely standard Java module generated by Maven.

It should also be possible to have Kotlin and Java code in the same module. However that would require manual editing of configuration for the Maven plugins and is likely to be more complicated.
